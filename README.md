## Getting Started
The SDK is available for download [on our website][parse-download-link] or our [NuGet package][nuget-link].

## Using hosted Parse
Before executing the following code, be sure to read the guide for Unity on [http://docs.parseplatform.org/unity/guide/](http://docs.parseplatform.org/unity/guide/)

```cs
using Parse;

// some code of initialization..

ParseClient.Initialize(new ParseClient.Configuration {
    ApplicationId = applicationID,
    WindowsKey = dotnetKey,

    // the serverURL of your hosted Parse Server
    Server = "<YOUR SERVER URL>"
});
```

## Building The Library
You can build the library from Visual Studio 2013+ or Xamarin IDE. You can also build the library using the command line:

```batch
:: In Windows:
MSBuild Parse.sln
```

```bash
# In Unix with Xamarin SDK installed:
xbuild Parse.sln
```

Results can be found in `Parse/bin`
